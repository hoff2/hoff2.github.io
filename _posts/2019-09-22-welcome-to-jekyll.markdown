A month ago I went to [one of][dsmwg-event] Des Moines Web Geeks' lunch talks
where Mike Cole presented about GitHub Pages. I'd been aware of GitHub pages for
a while but hadn't really tried making use of it. I'd had another website I was
writing in Jekyll, even had a couple blog posts on it at times when I wasn't in
one of my "refraining from all public statements" phases. I had been considering
getting back into it and Mike's talk reminded me that I kind of wanted to try
using my GitHub pages user site for something, after all it's pretty much free.
So now here it is, Yet Another Programmer Blog. Welcome.
