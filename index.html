        My name is Chuck. I live in Des Moines, Iowa, and I am a software
        developer. You can probably hire me right about now; I'm pretty good and
        might not be feeling too picky right now, what with the world cracking
        apart and all. I'm adaptable at using a variety of technologies and get
        off on learning new ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        After playing games like Oregon Trail on the school Apple IIe computers
        as a kid in the mid 1980s I just had to know how they made this stuff. I
        started reading about programming. My first programs, in BASIC, were
        written in pencil in a spiral notebook and later typed in at the public
        library. Within a few years I had learned Pascal and a little bit of
        assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Apple II line went extinct and I didn't have the perspective to
        understand what in my skills was still useful. PCs were advancing too
        fast to keep up with when my family couldn't afford to be buying another
        computer every year. So I got out of the code game and threw myself into
        music. Band was pretty much the only reason I bothered to show up to
        high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried going to college to be a composer but ended up discovering and
        being corrupted by the Internet. I dropped out, then made zines and
        played in a bunch of weird lo-fi/punk/noise bands for a few years and
        lived that dirtbag life. The only kind of job I could manage to hold
        down long-term was delivering pizza. After a while I got married and
        lived in a trailer park.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high-school friend who had found his way into IT encouraged me to get
        back into computers. I enrolled in one of those 2-year colleges that
        advertised on the Maury show. By graduation I realized that software
        development was my calling but I was going to need a Bachelors degree to
        be taken seriously as a job candidate. Eventually, at the age of 30, I
        got one. I'd made a point to study Computer Science foundations and
        theory over specific technologies, so that I'd have an underlying basis
        to learn and move with changing technology. That adaptability has been
        my credo ever since but it can be challenging to convince an employer
        that my 5 years each in Scala and full-stack Rails make my .NET Core
        experience equivalent to more than the 6 months or so it counts for on
        paper. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting laid off from the only cool tech startup in Black Hawk
        County, I moved to Des Moines and I been out here grindin ever since.
        I've been called a unicorn and a Swiss army knife and a whole lot of
        other complimentary things I'm weirdly uncomfortable with. Accepting
        compliments has never been my strong suit. The spouse from two
        paragraphs ago and I have stuck together throughout, had a couple weird
        kids and a few cats too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got struggles and opinions and eccentricities and I find it
        soul-crushing to pretend otherwise. If you can't handle that, we might
        not get along, but don't let that dissuade you from giving us a chance
        -- I'm generally accommodating to a fault, at least at first. This world
        is not my home, I'm just hear to learn and maybe teach a little.

clean them up a bit and make them blog posts. One thing I noticed was that

Therefore I hope these posts are informative to someone.</p>

<p>Q: When might you want to use a NoSQL database instead of SQL?</p>

<p>Generally speaking, a database is any store of data and the means to find and
use what is in it, which may include a query language such as SQL. The file
system(s) used by the operating system on your computer is also a database, and
you might even think of file names/paths as part of a query language for it. A
file system has metadata for keeping track of where the bits that are called by
a given filename in a given folder are physically kept on the disk (or whatever
storage medium you might be abstractly referring to as a “disk”), so as to help
the software to find, use, add, and modify files in ways a user might request.</p>

<p>These same factors also define other kinds of databases: a way of organizing
data in some storage medium; facilities for accessing, calculating from, adding
to, and modifying it; and metadata (such as indexes) to support these
facilities. Various database architectures have different ways of implementing
these things that can support different logical models of data access to varying
degrees of speed and space efficiency.</p>

<p>The term “NoSQL” is interesting because I suspect that it may be highlighting
the wrong variable and thereby misleading. The defining factors of NoSQL
databases as opposed to what users of this term mean by SQL databases seems to
me to have more to do with the underlying architecture and features of a
database engine, than with the SQL query language itself. But SQL is closely
correlated to what are called relational databases, a model which has dominated
the field of databases, in the sense of which most people think of the term
“database”, for a number of years now.</p>

<p>Relational databases provide a logical model of data arranged in tables, the
rows being data records, containing fields (arranged in columns) that hold the
component data of the records. There are keys to uniquely identify particular
records, foreign keys to express <em>relationships</em> between records, be they in the
same table or different, and indexes to help the system locate records by keys.
It’s all fairly intuitive to folks who know their way around spreadsheets and
also quite logically flexible. Relational databases almost universally offer an
SQL interface, but I have also seen SQL-like languages offered for other kinds
of data stores such as ksqldb for Kafka, and proprietary specialized dialects
like this one thing Salesforce has that I can’t remember the name of right now.
They have become the default choices of database to back most applications that
need something they can’t get from, say, sticking stuff in files; to the degree
that the term “database” has become nearly synonymous with them, and the
occupation of “database administrator” likewise synonymous with someone skilled
at working with SQL, various extensions of SQL, and relational database
solutions in general or specific.</p>

<p>Relational databases have been so dominant for so long for good reason. They are
good general-purpose databases and a lot of work over a long time has gone into
making them good. They give you facilities to be able to do just about anything
with the data they contain that you might conceivably dream up, almost as
quickly as you can dream it up. You can put lots of data in an SQL database and
get a lot out functionality of it easily.  Right now I’d still say if you’re
building a new product, there’s almost no reason not to at least start off with
one of these databases even if you’re keeping your options open in the longer
term. Free and open-source solutions like PostgreSQL are competitive with
commercial offerings like Microsoft SQL or Oracle, and at small scale and/or
early stages of a product you can even go with something easy and
low-maintenance like MySQL or SQLite. You can run them on your own laptop and do
all the nasty things to them you could ever want to try as you develop a
product.</p>

<p>But yeah, this is the hegemony that birthed the NoSQL meme. Some tech companies
were getting big doing some innovative stuff and found themselves reaching
performance and scale needs that relational databases weren’t up for. Being
pretty good at a lot of things sometimes leaves you coming up short on very
specific things, especially things that were rarer when the system was initially
designed. Everything’s a trade-off. Demand increased for distributed and
parallel computing to handle high load, and relational databases often weren’t
the best at scaling out. Replication exists but it’s pretty meh, and sharding is
helpful for some things but can be difficult to get right. Other kinds of
databases needed to be found or built to meet new needs.</p>

<p>The NoSQL movement may be little more than a recognition of these conditions.
Its effect has seemed to be to bring attention to other kinds of database
systems. A caching system can get by with less features for structuring data so
long as it can access it quickly. A reporting system would have more need for
pulling a lot of data at once and flexibility in structuring it, but place less
importance on the data being up-to-the-millisecond consistent across your
enterprise. Through message- and event-driven system design techniques, one can
even represent the same information in multiple different databases to support
different applications. NoSQL was mostly about recognizing that we had more
choices than we might have realized.</p>

<p>So ultimately, the answer to the question of when you might want to use a SQL
database versus a NoSQL one comes down to the old “consultants’ answer” of “it
depends.” But what I hope I have been able to get across is a good sense of what
kinds of things it might depend <em>on</em>. There exist now a variety of database
solutions besides SQL/relational, all focused on being good at different things.
The question isn’t so much SQL versus NoSQL, as it is a choice among a variety
of databases of which SQL is but one subcategory.</p>

<p>Q: “Can you explain what inversion of control or dependency injection is and
what benefit it provides?”</p>

<p>Dependency Injection/Inversion Of Control is a concept that came up in the
theory around object-oriented programming some years back. The general idea is,
you have some procedure in your program that needs to get at some data values,
system resources, and other procedures to be able to do its job. When or how you
specify all these things are a matter of how you design your code. Given an OO
programming language, this procedure is probably a method on some class, so some
things may have been specified to the objects’ constructor; others might be
given as arguments to the method call. Or they may have been calculated,
provided through setter methods, or constructed from other things in the
meantime. The constructor is itself a method with parameters, whose job is to
give you a new instance of this class, and those parameters can technically be
anything or nothing, just like any other method. In between the constructor,
other setup of state done beforehand within the class scope, and parameters,
eventually the method has everything it needs if it is to work.</p>

<p>You find that in purely Functional Programming circles you rarely hear
dependency injection talked about, let alone stressed about, the way it has in
OO programming. At a basic level one could say that this because in these
languages everything is made out of pure functions, so technically the only way
to get things into a function is through its parameters, so you don’t have all
these choices to weigh. This might sound like a nightmare if you care much about
functions having a lot of parameters. But then that’s what closures are for,
<a href="/2019-10-06-functional-fun/">which are how FP “does” objects</a>, as it turns out,
and out of them you also get currying and monads.</p>

<p>In the early days of object orientation, as its dominance in industry was new,
many design principles, patterns, and practices we’ve since come to take for
granted were yet to grow. Much of the field was still thinking in Procedural or
Structured Programming terms and was still figuring out how to use the tool of
OO <em>well</em>. This is normal. I’ve since seen it happen with Actors and
Microservices and arguably even Functional Programming, with three-quarters of a
century of history behind it, is still lacking in some of this area.</p>

<p>Object Oriented programming languages’ native facility for invoking an object is
to call a class constructor. Often there is a special language keyword to do
this, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>. If you need some kind of object, this is supposedly how you
get it. If that constructor needs some other objects though, what does it do?
It’s not entirely unreasonable to think that that constructor would go off and
call other constructors and so people did that sort of thing a lot.</p>

<p>However, this started to lead to some nasty smells. One would find oneself
writing constructors that need a whole lot of parameters, even if it’s just so
it can pass most of those parameters on to other constructors; writing out the
very long calls to those many-parametered constructors, “threading through”
parameters from one class to another to another, and probably getting parameters
in the wrong order several times and other prosaic human errors that happen when
you’re dealing with complicated code. To make matters worse, you ended up with
classes and methods that are bound to specific context-dependent things in your
application and don’t easily generalize to other circumstances; OO’s promise of
reusable code fails to come through. This got especially hairy with the growing
popularity of unit testing and test-driven development – you would try to set
up a test suite for some class in your code and find that you had to build out a
whole hairball of stuff just to set up an instance to test on, and then someone
would tell you that if you were doing that then it wasn’t true “unit” testing,
and you’d throw up your hands and go back to your old ways.</p>

<p>Eventually some genius remembered that we can pass <em>objects</em> along as parameters
too, so we could just build those downstream dependencies ahead of time and pass
them in. “Injecting” your dependencies’ dependencies into them, instead of just
letting your dependencies build all their own dependencies, this “inversion” of
the “control” over dependencies, passed for enough of a mindshift to make it a
buzzword.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was considered such a mindshift that people decided they couldn’t
handle the responsibility themselves and needed to have frameworks called
Dependency Injection “Containers” to do the heavy lifting. It was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code>’s fault
for letting us call it wherever we want; instead we should let this container
use reflection and/or big XML configuration files to find all the right things
to plug into all the constructors for us so that wherever we wrote methods,
whatever they needed could just be there. After all, “dependency resolution” was
something of a solved problem in the realm of the <em>installation</em> of software. We
had package systems for Linux distros, as well as those to manage library code
our projects depend on. They build a data representation of what depends on
what, and what other whats those whats depend on, on down to the whats that
don’t depend on any other whats, and go and find the right versions of the right
things and put them where they’re needed.</p>

<p>DI/IoC Containers caught on widely in the worlds of enterprise Java and C#. This
way of handling dependencies within a project had apparent time-saving benefits
due to what it lets you avoid thinking about, against the tradeoff that it gives
you an incentive to not think about those things. When you write a class you
simply stick on the annotation that plugs it into the DI container, and now you
don’t have to think much about how to structure dependencies.</p>

<p>In practice, how this often plays out is that if you’re coding in some new
functionality and want some dependency the class doesn’t already have in scope,
you just add it to the constructor and keep going. Heck, often the IDE will just
do it for you with a keyboard shortcut. You don’t care how long that constructor
signature gets because you never have to write a call to it anyway. The
constructor’s signatures get bigger and bigger and the import lists at the top
of the files get longer and longer and your unit tests have to set up more and
more mocks but because all this grew a little at a time you’ve stopped noticing
it, like the people on Hoarders who are immune to the smell of their own homes.
Without applying some design discipline, at the end of the day, this state of
affairs is not only hardly better than just cramming a lot of stuff into a
global namespace, it’s worse because it fills your code with boilerplate, and
your classes lose all cohesion or real meaning beyond being arbitrary bags of
dependencies. What’s a separation of concerns?</p>

<p>In Scala’s early days of aiming to be a “better Java”, they tried to improve on
this with a scoping feature called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">implicit</code> that ended up replicating similar
problems in the form of a certain crime against humanity called the Cake
Pattern. Implicits came to be widely hated, though maybe not always fairly; they
ended up being repurposed to build out an FP concept called typeclasses, which
sound awesome until you realize they’re kind of just interfaces.</p>

<p>DI/IoC containers continue to be popular, especially in the context of
opinionated-architecture application frameworks in popular enterprise
platforms/languages, and I’m able to work with them. When it’s up to me,
however, I prefer to use basic constructor- or setter-based DI methods in a
manner influenced by things like hexagonal/ports-and-adapters or DCI
architectures. Even then, messes get made.</p>

      <p>Once upon a time I blogged a lot. Then I kind of got over myself. I have strong opinions weakly held so I don’t feel a need to evangelize them much. I may try to put in an article here every so often to just say how I am and how things are going in general though. I guess it doesn’t hurt to sort of reintroduce yourself each time you post if it’s infrequent. It’s just your new home page anyway. Not like I have followers.</p>

<p>I’m a software developer in Iowa. I’m about agile and TDD and pairing and collaboration and collective learning and stuff. I’m less about specific like, frameworks or programming languages or platforms or “tech stacks”. A lot of underlying ideas are repeated and refined over the years in successive products and you start to kind of automatically pattern-match new ones as they crop up. Or at least I do. I’m not sure everyone has this experience. Learning builds upon previous learning in a network model though so the potential connections grow at a higher order than the number of concepts they might connect. Humans are pattern matching machines and we kind of prime ourselves for these experiences if we can. I’m cynical on the cult of smart, though.</p>

<p>Naturally, I’m writing for something to do at the moment because I don’t have current work. Maybe you could hire me. I’m pretty ok. Check out the about page and anything else you can find from the menus up top.</p>

<p>thank.</p>

  <p>The following was written June 1, 2020 and originally posted to mental
health-related internal chat rooms where I worked at the time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yesterday was the last day of Mental Health Awareness Month.</p>

<p>Yesterday would also have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Willis">Wesley
Willis’s</a> 57th birthday.</p>

<p>If you’re from the Alternative Nation Generation, you may remember Wesley Willis
as something of a curiosity, maybe a bit of a joke and a distastefully
exploitative one at that, the sort of thing that would never pass in today’s
social climate and should probably be left where we left it. A mentally ill
street musician from Chicago (to most, with the word “musician” enclosed in
irony-quotes) whom seemingly somebody allowed to start releasing albums and
playing clubs for amusements’ sake, sparking a weird 1990s fad with a rather
long tail on it.</p>

<p>The truth has a lot more to it though, and today I want to talk about what that
story obscures and misses that Wesley Willis fans and friends-of-friends like
myself knew. I want to shine a light on the man Wesley Willis was. The man who
faced adversity after adversity and never lost the beautiful soul that inspired
friends, brought joy to mass numbers of music nerds, and ultimately made it
possible for Wesley Willis to make way for himself to live authentically in a
world all but designed specifically against him. Whose sincerity and enthusiasm
made him an effortlessly savvy self-promoter and brought him opportunities and
agency denied to so many others like him. Who worked hard at doing what he both
loved and needed and radiated love as he did it. It would be to no one’s
surprise his time on Earth was short, but he made the absolute most of it.</p>

<p>Two documentary films have been made about Mr. Willis, and of the two, one still
has a bit of that snicker-at-the-freak smell on it. The one I’d like to invite
people to check out if they can find it, <em>Wesley Willis’s Joyrides</em>, focuses on
his life story and personal accounts from his closest friends and also gives
space to his no less substantial visual arts career. While many have found
Wesley Willis’s compositional methods primitive and maddeningly repetitive,
there is much depth to be found for those willing to grant time and attention to
his oeuvre. In this moment I would particularly like to highlight those songs in
which Wesley Willis dealt frankly with his experiences with mental illness:
“Chronic Schizophrenia” and “Outburst” from “Greatest Hits Vol. 1” are easy to
find but there are many more.</p>

<p>On June 1 2020, I can say that not only is the world a bit cooler place for
having had Wesley Willis in it, but fortunate and downright lucky that Wesley
Willis never met the fate of George Floyd or so many other black men and
neurodivergent black men throughout our country’s history.</p>

<p>RIP Wesley Willis, you are still loved like a milkshake.</p>

      <p>It’s been weird times lately for me, and for many others. If it hasn’t been
weird times for you, that must be some nice bubble you’re living in.</p>

<p>I write this on a Sunday. Friday was my last day as an employee of The Des
Moines Forge Of Pillar Part Of Industry X.0 By Accenture. Fortunately I’m a
techbro and had a job offer the same day at a slightly higher salary. I don’t
think I’m going to take it.</p>

<p>I happened to rewatch <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3715406"><em>Atari: Game Over</em></a>
yesterday. In it, Howard Warshaw, developer of not only the ill-fated <em>E.T.</em>
game but also such unquestionable classics as <em>Yar’s Revenge</em>, reflected on how
his brief experience at Atari kind of ruined him for subsequent job prospects.
Made him expect better, want more, be less willing to compromise for the sake of
going along with the typical corporate environment. Not just because of the wild
party culture of Atari in the early 1980s but just as much because of the
heights of creative achievement that he and his co-workers reached together,
enabled by that openness in which they could bring their whole selves to work.</p>

<p>When I came on at Pillar, it was in the process of being acquired by Accenture.
Accenture is the biggest corporation you never heard of. It employs literally
half a million people globally in all sorts of consulting and professional
services sectors. I knew of this, it was brought up in my interviews. I seem to
have a knack for coming into companies at these moments; my hiring at Banno, my
previous job, came at much the same juncture of their acquisition by Jack Henry
&amp; Associates. And just like with Banno, the message that went out in Pillar was
that what the acquirer saw in the acquiree, the thing to which they attributed
the smaller company’s success that made it such an attractive acquisition
target, was its great culture, and that the big company’s intentions were to
learn from that and spread the lessons out to the larger company and with that
we were going to rock the world and it was going to be great.</p>

<p>I’ve had a fraught relationship with employment all my legally-employable life.
The workplace was always just an even more repressive corner of an already
repressive world where I never quite belonged and suffered because of it, yet if
I didn’t find a way to slot myself into it, I would never be able to support
myself or a family. Pillar brought me out of the shell I’d built around myself
since I was a child, showed me my viewpoint was valid and valued in a way I
didn’t realize was possible. It took time for me to adjust and really begin to
open up, and I still feel like that process was interrupted in the middle, but I
am so overwhelmingly grateful to the people I worked alongside at the Forge that
helped that happen. It was a culture that delighted in being eccentric and that
spirit made us powerful and because of it we did awesome work. Pillar showed me
that I could be seen as more than just a human resource or a code monkey, that I
could be valued as a fully three-dimensional human being with all my flaws and
foibles and ambitions and silly jokes and wild ideas and nerdy interests.</p>

<p>A week ago Friday though, Accenture told me something very different. Even after
all the apparently sincere and ground-breaking diversity and inclusion rhetoric
I’d heard, and what I took to be so many refreshingly bullshit-free statements
from CEO Julie Sweet, ultimately the message Accenture gave me was that I was
expendable: that literally some opaque process running in some cloud, triggered
by a fluctuation in a stock price or some such thing, could go and query an
employee database according to some algorithm, based off data like how many of
my work hours were directly billable to an already-won client, and by those
results could decide my professional fate, and that that was just totally normal
and the way things are done. Because that is evidently the world we are in now.</p>

<p>And this may be what sucks the most now, is that, after Pillar, I don’t think I
can bring myself to settle for anything less… but what more, really, is out
there?</p>

<p>Last Fall, I had the great honor, made possible by Accenture even, to be paid a
normal work day’s salary to be a guest lecturer for Hour Of Code, which is to
say that I along with several of my Forge co-workers spent a day helping to
guide public-school classrooms full of middle-school kids through some fun
coding exercises, where they could learn a little about what I do for a living.
One of the biggest things I was struck by and took away from that day was how
much more diverse those classrooms were from the rooms I typically spent a
workday in. To be slightly flippant about it, there were actually Black kids
there. And Hispanic kids. There was a Muslim girl (I’m assuming a little bit
here – she was brown-skinned and had a hijab on) who was joyously competing
with her Black friend next to her for who could complete the exercises quicker.
I remember thinking that if I’m in a position to influence hiring decisions in
ten years or so I sure hope these kids apply. And there were also kids that were
totally not into it, who thought all this techie stuff was bullshit, like the
Black girl who aspired to be a journalist, and I saw her point of view as no
less valid, because kids like her are used to seeing white dudes with glasses
like me doing this stuff, not people like them, and also because journalism is
totally important and we need it, and yet, we’re talking about language here,
which is all code really is, and even if you don’t make software your career,
understanding how it works is only going to be more crucial to your success in
this society going forward. I didn’t quite have the guts to say what I really
wanted to say, because I wasn’t the real teacher and it wasn’t my class. But
that was the beginnings of some notions in my head that I have higher purposes
to serve than just building another accounts-payable system.</p>

<p>I don’t know what my future holds but I don’t think I’m likely to just take
another plain old tech job. The kind of thing I really want to do involves
sharing the joy of creativity that comes with my profession and helping young
people find their way into it that might otherwise give it up before they get
the chance; because I nearly did too, and that’s a whole other story. Pillar was
the first place I worked that tried to truly treat that kind of ambition as part
of the job, and whatever your company is, if you can’t get down with that, I
don’t think I can fuck with you anymore.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I have maybe a couple months worth of financial cushion in which to
try to sort this all out. That’s not a privilege I ever had before.</p>

<p>Like I said at the top of this rant, these are weird times. Hunter S. Thompson
is famously credited with saying, “When the going gets weird, the weird turn
pro.” I’ve been weird my whole life and this is my time to shine.</p>
