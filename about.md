## Who I Am

They call me Chuck. I live in Des Moines, Iowa. I sling code for a living. This
is where I blog about it, very sparsely. I've got a full time gig I plan to
stick around in until they decide they don't like me anymore.

## What I do

### Programming

Any language will do. I'm good at picking up programming languages as needed,
within reason, especially if I have an existing codebase to work with. The bulk
of my professional experience has been in Scala, Ruby (much of that with Rails),
PHP, Javascript, and ActionScript, but I've dabbled in many others. I've long
been comfortable around a Linux command prompt or an Apache config. I like being
able to deploy what I write. I've also installed Wordpress and things like it
dozens of times so let me know if you need some help with something like that.

I began working as a programmer professionally in late 2005, a few months before
receiving my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from University of Northern
Iowa. I nerd out about things like object-oriented design and functional
programming. Trying new things is one of the most exciting parts of the job, but
I've also a respect for the tried and true and a healthy suspicion for using the
new and shiny just for its own sake. I'm not above a quick hack when it's the
right thing, but I get a warm feeling from leaving code cleaner and more
maintainable than I found it.

### Music, especially on the bass guitar

I do a bunch of weird music too. I'm heavy into noise and the avant-garde in
general. I have another blog about that stuff. I play a mean bass guitar and
could probably do some session work if you want. I can improvise, learn songs
quickly or work up my own parts, and am pretty handy around a mixing board.

### Writing, especially about music or tech

I've blogged obsessively at various times in my life, usually opinionated
editorial kinds of things on software development, music, or politics, and have
done quite a few music reviews both on my own sites and others'. I love
researching things. I have no credentials to speak of. However, I believe that
whatever talents I have in programming and music stem from being a writer by
nature, as music and programming are, as I see it, forms of language.
